    <h1>Flying Together</h1>
    <h2>Unity game, with graphics made in Photoshop and Illustrator</h2>
    <h2>September 2018</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      Created for the Fuse Jam where I was given the emotion "love" and some kind of springy noise (which disapeared along the way).
    </p><p>
      The idea is that you must play the game on one keyboard with someone else, getting quite close. You must collect as many glow bugs as possible, without being hit by storm clouds.
    </p><p>
      This is the first Unity game I have made for a game jam, and I made it entirely on my own over the weekend.
