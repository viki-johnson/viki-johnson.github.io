    <h2>Construct 2 game, with graphics made in Photoshop and Illustrator</h2>

    <p>
      Resist Jam asked developers to make games that went against authoritarianism, promoting diversity, freedom and expression through interactive media.
    </p><p>
      Instead of looking at this in a blatantly political manner, I looked at climate change, something that is often overlooked by certain politicians and
      not always taken seriously.
    </p><p>
      In this small game, you have to re-enter the earth's atmosphere, in a time when it is no longer habitable. You visit different areas of the world to
      collect the seeds from that place and plant them on your ship.
    </p><p>
      Once I have finished my current game, I will be making this into a full game, aiming for a PC and mobile release. It will show the devastating effects
      of climate change on the world, while also educating players about the flowers and plants that are found in only a few places on earth, and are at risk
      of extinction.
    </p><p>
      This version just features a few levels, one of which features the primrose, a flower native to the English county of Devon, where I grew up. So that
      satisfied the diversifier of the jam asking developers to include something of their native area.
