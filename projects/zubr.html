    <h1>Parklife Festival 2019</h1>
    <h2>Facebook Filter / Jan 2019</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      A filter that would activate from fliers given out around train stations, revealing hints to this year's line up.
      I took the graphics from the festival poster and made a 3D version in Facebook's Spark AR.

    <h1>Crack Magazine x Aphex Twin</h1>
    <h2>Facebook Filter & App / Nov 2018</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      To celebrate an interview with Aphex Twin in local music magazine Crack, we made an app and Facebook filter to emphasise his unique style.
      <p>
        I created shaders for app, which uses image recognition on that particular issue of Crack, and I developed the Facebook filter, which places
        icon Aphex Twin faces on top of your own.

    <h1>Window to the Past</h1>
    <h2>preloaded iOS app in ARKit / Nov 2018</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      As part of a group of heritage projects in the Bristol Old Vic, we worked with a couple of other companies to create an app to take theatre-goers
      back in time, and see the lovely new foyer how it would have been centuries ago.
    <p>
      I was the lead programmer on this project and developed AR portals to transport the user into prerendered 360s, and started to learn the magic
      of shaders to create more interesting visual effects

    <h1>Saddleback at Rouleur Classic</h1>
    <h2>preloaded iOS app in ARKit / Oct 2018</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      For an elite biking show in London, we worked with a local luxury cycling brand, Saddleback, to make digital additions to their exhibition.
    </p><p>
      I developed AR windows, which are a pretty neat way of showing 180 videos, and are triggered from words printed on the wall. Using graphical shaders
      in Unity, the videos would change depending on your distance to them, with a glitching transition. I also created AR labels for their products, giving
      a futurist way of sharing information about their shoes and wheels, and keeping to their cyberpunk-esque theme.

    <h1>Changing Spaces</h1>
    <h2>Facebook Filter / Jul 2018</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      My first Facebook filter was created for the British Council in India, and takes you back in time to sixty years ago.

    <h1>AR Treasure Hunt</h1>
    <h2>Preloaded app / Apr 2018</h2>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>
      A bespoke app, created to tie in with an adventure holiday, featuring a number of very small minigames and animated scenes. As this was my first
      project at Zubr, I mostly arranged things within the scenes and added particle effects. This was my only AR project in Vuforia.
